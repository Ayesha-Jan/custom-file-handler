# ðŸ“‚ Custom File Handler & ðŸŽ² Dice Roll Simulator

This repository contains two Python projects demonstrating different features:

---

# ðŸ“‚ Custom File Handler

This project demonstrates the creation of a custom Python object for file handling, with support for file reading via generators, operator overloading, decorators, inheritance, and automated testing using pytest.

---

## Features

- Custom file object with getter/setter validation
- File reading using Python generators
- Operator overloading with + to concatenate files
- Custom ANSI-colored string representation via decorators
- Inheritance with extended functionality in a subclass
- Support for concatenating multiple files
- Unit testing using pytest
- Linting and formatting with flake8 and black
- GitHub Actions CI for automated tests and formatting
- Makefile for easy development workflow

---

# ðŸŽ² Dice Roll Simulator

Simulates dice rolls and plots their frequency distribution using matplotlib. Demonstrates generators, decorators, plotting, and automated testing.

---

## Features

- Generator function for dice rolls
- Decorator to plot roll frequency distributions
- Matplotlib visualization
- Automated tests with pytest
- Linting and formatting with flake8 and black
- Makefile commands integrated with main project

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+

### Clone the Repository 
    
    git clone https://github.com/Ayesha-Jan/custom-file-handler.git
    cd custom-file-handler

## How to Run Tests
Make sure you have a Python virtual environment set up:

    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
    pip install -r requirements.txt

Then run:

    make test

---

## Makefile Commands

    make test      # Run tests using pytest
    make lint      # Lint code with flake8
    make format    # Format code with black
    make clean     # Remove .pyc and cache files
