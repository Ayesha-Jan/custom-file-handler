# ðŸ“‚ Custom File Handler

This project demonstrates the creation of a custom Python object for file handling, with support for file reading via generators, operator overloading, decorators, inheritance, and automated testing using `pytest`.

---

## Features

- Custom file object with getter/setter validation
- File reading using Python generators
- Operator overloading with `+` to concatenate files
- Custom ANSI-colored string representation via decorators
- Inheritance with extended functionality in a subclass
- Support for concatenating multiple files
- Unit testing using `pytest`
- Linting and formatting with `flake8` and `black`
- GitHub Actions CI for automated tests and formatting
- Makefile for easy development workflow
